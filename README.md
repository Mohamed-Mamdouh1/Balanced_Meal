# Balanced_Meal
This Flutter-based application allows users to create a personalized food order by selecting ingredients from multiple categories (Vegetables, Meats, and Carbs) while tracking total calorie intake based on their personal health data. The app dynamically interacts with Firebase Firestore and integrates with an external API to place food orders.
